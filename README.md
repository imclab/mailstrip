# mailstrip

mailstrip is a [Go][2] library that parses email text and strips it of
signatures and reply quotes. It is a port of [email\_reply\_parser][1], GitHub's
library for parsing email replies.

At this point mailstrip is 100% line-by-line port, including the test suite.
However, this may change in the future.
